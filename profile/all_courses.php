                A timer will track the minutes you spend on each section. You must click on the submit
                button to receive full credit. A 'keep alive' box will pop up every few minutes. If you
                are not present to click the button, you will be returned to this page, and the timer
                will stop. If you leave the section without clicking the submit button, you may lose
                some of your earned time.
